# this is a fake job that exists only so somebody can say 'start -n
# start_update'.  In order to be a legal upstart job, however, it must
# have an exec or script line

# Jobfiles for daemons that ought to be stopped during an update can
# simply "stop on started start_update".  But tasks cannot: they are
# in the stopped state, not running, so they would have to "start on
# started start_update".  Their scripts can tell why they were
# started, and can pass "stop" to their @WEBOS_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR@/init.d script, but
# upstart will still emit a "started" event to every jobfile down the
# line.  We don't want that.  For now, just list them here.

# The call to stop networking is done in the stop_comms script, in the
# shutdownscripts component.
