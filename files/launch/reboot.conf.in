# reboot - runlevel 6 compatibility
#
# This task runs the old sysv-rc runlevel 0 ("halt/poweroff") scripts with
# the decision as to whether to halt or power off the system left up to the
# script (and thus @WEBOS_INSTALL_DEFAULTCONFDIR@/poweroff).

# runlevel 6 means reboot
start on runlevel 6

#stop on runlevel [!6]
