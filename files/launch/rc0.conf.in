# rc0 - runlevel 0 compatibility
#
# This task runs the old sysv-rc runlevel 0 ("halt/poweroff") scripts with
# the decision as to whether to halt or power off the system left up to the
# script (and thus @WEBOS_INSTALL_DEFAULTCONFDIR@/poweroff).

# runlevel 0 means shutting down.
start on runlevel 0

stop on runlevel [!0]
